Quick Start
===========

Note: DataRobot MLOps agent is part of the DataRobot MLOps product.

Before you start
----------------

#. Know the URL of DataRobot MLOps; For on-prem installations, this is typically of the form
   `https://10.0.0.1` or `https://my-server-name`.
#. Obtain an API token from DataRobot MLOps. You can do this through the UI by going to the **Developer Tools** tab under account settings
   and finding the **API Keys** section.


Set up the deployment environment
---------------------------------

Agent Hosts
***********

Perform the following for each machine that will be used to upload data to
DataRobot MLOps. This setup only needs to be performed once for each deployment environment.

#. Ensure that Java (version 8) is installed.
#. Download the DataRobot MLOps package TAR file available through the UI under the user icon -> **Developer Tools** -> **External Monitoring Agent**. The TAR file includes the agent and library software, example code, documentation, and associated scripts.
#. Change directory into the unpacked directory.
#. Run the agent using the following procedures:

    #. :ref:`Install the agent <agent-instructions>`.
    #. :ref:`Configure the agent <agent-configuration>`.
    #. :ref:`Start the agent service <agent-instructions>`.

Prediction Hosts
****************

On each machine that will be using the MLOps library to report predictions, ensure that appropriate libraries/requirements
are installed.

*Java*: the Java library is included in the tar file in `lib/datarobot-mlops-<version>.jar`.

*Python*: the Python version of the library is included in the tar file in `lib/datarobot_mlops-*-py2.py3-none-any.whl`. This works
for both Python2 and Python3. You can install it using `pip install lib/datarobot_mlops-*-py2.py3-none-any.whl`.


(Optional) Try the Examples
---------------------------
The agent tar file includes several end-to-end examples in various languages.

:doc:`More information on examples <examples>`.

Create a Model Package and Deploy It
------------------------------------

Before you can begin monitoring, you must create a model package and deploy it.
A model package stores metadata about your external model: the problem type (e.g., regression),
the training data used, etc. Once you have a model package, you can deploy it to a prediction environment
(test environment, production environment, etc.). Monitoring metrics are tracked per deployment. You can create
and deploy your model package through the UI or through the API.

Through the UI
**************

You can create a model package through the UI's **Model Registry** page.  Once
you have a model package, you can deploy it. In the deployment's **Integrations** tab, you can view example code
as well as the values for the MLOPS_DEPLOYMENT_ID and MLOPS_MODEL_ID that you will need when reporting
statistics from your deployment.


Through the API
***************

Helper scripts for creating model packages and deployments are available in the `examples` directory.
Every example has its own script to create the related model package and deployment in
a `create_deployment.sh` script.
This script interacts with DataRobot MLOps directly and so must be run on a machine with
connectivity to it.
When run, it returns a deployment ID and model ID that you will need to instrument your deployment.

Instrument your deployment
--------------------------

For each deployment, do the following:

#. Locate the MLOps library and sample code. These are included within the MLOps TAR file distribution.
#. Configure the deployment ID and model ID in your environment.
#. Instrument your code with MLOps calls as shown in the sample code provided for your programming language.
#. To report results to DataRobot MLOps, you must configure the library to use the same channel
   as is configured in the agent.
   For testing, you can configure the library to output to stdout though these calls will
   not be forwarded to the agent or DataRobot MLOps.
   Configure the library via the :ref:`mlops API <mlops-lib>`.
#. You can view your deployment in the DataRobot MLOps UI under the **Deployments** tab.
