Overview
========

You can find DataRobot's main documentation within your DataRobot application by browsing to
`domain-name/docs/` or, from the UI, clicking the book icon on the upper right.
There you will find an overview of DataRobot's MLOps agent monitoring agent (`domain-name/docs/deploy/mlops-agent/`),
its components, and use cases. In addition, the DataRobot documentation contains complete information for using the
model management tools for monitoring accuracy, data drift, prediction distribution, latency, etc.

DataRobot's MLOps agent can be used to monitor and manage external deployments, i.e., those running outside
of DataRobot's infrastructure.

After following the steps and procedures presented here, those deployments and their prediction data will be shown in
the DataRobot MLOps UI.
An overview of the monitoring process follows. You can find more details by following the
:ref:`Quickstart guide <quickstart-guide>`.


On DataRobot MLOps
******************

#. Use the **Model Registry** to create a model package with information about your model's metadata.
#. Deploy the model package. This will create a *deployment* that will be used to display
   metrics about the running model.
#. Use the deployment **Integrations** tab to view a code snippet demonstrating how to instrument your
   prediction code to report metrics.


In your Deployment Environment
******************************

#. Install the DataRobot MLOps agent.
#. Use the MLOps library to report metrics from your prediction code as demonstrated by the snippet.
#. The MLOps library buffers the metrics in a *spooler*,
   which enables high throughput without slowing down the deployment. The type of spooler you use depends on your
   environment. Currently, the spooler could be the local filesystem, RabbitMQ, Amazon SQS, or Google PubSub.
#. The MLOps agent forwards the metrics to DataRobot MLOps.
#. You can view the reported metrics via the DataRobot MLOps user interface **Deployments** tab.

You can find more details for each of these steps in the relevant documentation sections.
