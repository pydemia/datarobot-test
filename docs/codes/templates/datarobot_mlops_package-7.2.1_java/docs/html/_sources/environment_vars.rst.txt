.. _env-vars:

The MLOps library and agent can be configured with the following environment variables.

| **MLOPS_SPOOLER_TYPE** - Set the spooler type that the MLOps library will use to communicate with the agent. Valid options are *FILESYSTEM*, *SQS*, *RABBITMQ*, and *PUBSUB*. The value of *NONE* can be used to disable MLOps library reporting and a value of *STDOUT* can be used to have the MLOps library print the reported metrics to stdout rather than forward them to the agent.
