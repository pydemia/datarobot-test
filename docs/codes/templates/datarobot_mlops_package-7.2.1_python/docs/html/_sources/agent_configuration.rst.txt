Agent configuration
===================

Edit the agent configuration file, `conf/mlops.agent.conf.yaml`.
You must update the values for `mlopsUrl` and `apiToken`.

By default, the agent will use the file system channel.
If you use the file system channel, make sure you create the spooler directory (by default this is `/tmp/ta`).
If you want to use a different channel, update the agent configuration file following the comments in the file.

.. _agent-configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../../build/mlops-agent-tarball/conf/mlops.agent.conf.yaml
