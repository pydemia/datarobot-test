This directory provides samples and examples for various languages and use cases.
- Samples only provide code snippets for manual inspection.
- Examples include model configuration, data, and scripts to create deployments and run the examples.

All examples (except the SingleCommand* examples) require the agent to be configured and
running prior to running the example. See the instructions in file://<agent_tar_dir>/docs/html/quickstart.html

To run an example:

1. First create the model package and initialize the deployment by running:
   create_deployment.sh

2. Set the environment variables for the deployment and the model returned from creating the deployment
   by copy/pasting them into your shell.
   export MLOPS_DEPLOYMENT_ID=<deployment_id>; export MLOPS_MODEL_ID=<model_id>

3. Then generate predictions and report statistics to MLOps by running:
   run_example.sh
