Examples
========

The `examples` directory contains both sample code (code snippets for manual inspection) and example code (self-contained
examples that can be run) for several languages and use cases.

Examples include model configuration, data, and scripts to create deployments and run the examples. For our examples,
we create the model packages and deployments programmatically rather than through the UI. All examples use Python to
programmatically create the model package and deployment. So you must install the Python version of the MLOps library
(as described here).

To run the Python examples, you need to install other dependencies used by the examples:
`pip install -r examples/python/requirements.txt`

To run an example:

#. First initialize the model package and deployment by running:
   `create_deployment.sh`

#. Set the environment variables for the deployment and the model returned from creating the deployment
   by copy/pasting them into your shell:
   `export MLOPS_DEPLOYMENT_ID=<deployment_id>; export MLOPS_MODEL_ID=<model_id>`

#. Generate predictions and report statistics to MLOps by running:
   `run_example.sh`
