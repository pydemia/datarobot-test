Bosun should be managing deployments in this k8s cluster now. It may take up to 10 minutes before you see new
deployments running. You can query for them by running the following command:
  kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} get pods -l bosun.datarobot.com/env={{ .Values.datarobot.predictionEnvId }}
